# Chemical-Reactions
Numerical Simulation of a chemical reaction network with Poissonian initial conditions.
Implementation of the Gillespie algorithm in FORTRAN.
It is implemented a reaction network of the kind A+B->C, A->0, 0->A, B->0, 0->B, C->0, 0->C.
Gives as outputs the evolution of the concentrations and the correlations between the reactants.
Code created as part of the final project to complete MSc.
